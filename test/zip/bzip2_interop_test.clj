  "Conformance for method 12 (bzip2), in both directions.

   `java.util.zip` cannot help here — it implements stored and deflate only — so
   the oracle is python's `zipfile`, which supports `ZIP_BZIP2`, plus the `unzip`
   binary where available. That asymmetry is the reason this lives in its own
   file rather than in `zip.jvm-interop-test`.

   Skipped loudly when python3 is missing."
