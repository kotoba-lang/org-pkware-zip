  "Runs the runtime-agnostic suite on ClojureScript via nbb:

   org-ietf-deflate checkout, since nbb has no dependency resolver).

   The JVM suite covers conformance against `java.util.zip`; this one exists so
   that building and reading a ZIP on a second runtime, with no host codec
   anywhere, is checked rather than asserted."
