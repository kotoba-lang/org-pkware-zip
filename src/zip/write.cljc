(ns zip.write
  "ZIP writing (PKWARE APPNOTE.TXT): local headers, the central directory, the
   end-of-central-directory record, and the ZIP64 structures when the archive
   needs them.

   Every member is compressed in memory, so sizes and CRC-32s are known before
   the local header is written and no data descriptors are needed — the shape
   that every reader, including the oldest, understands.

   Archives are **reproducible**: timestamps default to the MS-DOS epoch
   (1980-01-01), the version-made-by and external-attribute fields are constants,
   and nothing else varies. The same entries produce the same bytes, which is
   what makes a content-addressed `.docx`/`.epub`/`.sketch` possible.

   Deliberately absent: encryption (a ZIP feature nobody should still be using),
   split archives, and per-entry compression methods other than stored and
   deflate."
