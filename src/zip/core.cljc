  "ZIP container read and write (PKWARE APPNOTE.TXT). Sketch (.sketch), OOXML
   (.docx/.xlsx/.pptx), ODF and EPUB are all ZIPs — this lists, extracts and
   builds them in pure `.cljc`, with `org-ietf-deflate` as its only dependency.

   Reading is driven by the central directory (never by scanning for local
   headers), which is what makes it agree with `unzip` on archives that have
   prepended data, and it understands the ZIP64 structures a >4 GiB or
   >65535-entry archive uses.

   Three things this reader is deliberately strict about, because the previous
   version was not and each is a silent-corruption path:

   - **Unsupported compression methods raise.** Method 8 (deflate) and 0 (stored)
     are implemented; bzip2, LZMA, zstd, xz, PPMd and the AE-x encryption
     wrapper are not. Returning the *compressed* bytes as though they were the
     member's content — the old behaviour — hands a caller silent garbage.
   - **CRC-32 is verified** per member, along with the uncompressed size.
   - **Encrypted members raise** instead of yielding ciphertext.

   Extraction is separated from listing: `entries` reads the directory only, and
   `read-entry` decompresses one member. `parse` keeps the original eager
   behaviour (every member decompressed at once) for existing callers."
